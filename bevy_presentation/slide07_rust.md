- **System language:** Fast, compiled, no Runtime, no Garbage Collector
- **Cargo:** Modern all-in-one build and package manager
- **Very strict compiler:** Annoying when coding yourself but great to prevent AI slop
  - if it compiles, it usually works!
- **Modern:** Most of the features we love and some more like Macros
- **Allows very dense code:** Fewer tokens => smaller context window
