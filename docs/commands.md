Based on the existing src/bin/test_runner/terrain_test.rs: Implement a terrain
▌ creation according to the specs that looks like [image 683x384 PNG] . Create only
▌ the minimal necessary code. Understand the architecture before starting. In the end
▌ the terrain_test should succeed and verify that the actual terrain was spawned e.g.
▌ by checking existence of one or multiple components. Implement only the minimal
▌ game logic!

▌ Create a minimum camera.                   

Add some global illumination to the camera module. I want to see the terrain.
